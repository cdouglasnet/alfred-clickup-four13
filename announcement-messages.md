### Title: ClickUp Workflow for Alfred - Fast Task Creation & Search with Secure API Storage

### Post:
Hey Alfred community! üëã

I've created a new ClickUp workflow for Alfred that addresses many of the issues with existing workflows. After seeing several threads about broken ClickUp workflows, I built this from scratch for ClickUp 2.0.

**Key Features:**
- üîê Secure API key storage in macOS Keychain (no hardcoded credentials!)
- ‚ö° Lightning-fast task creation with `cu <task title>`
- üîç Fuzzy search across all your tasks with `cus`, `cuo`, and `cul` commands
- üè∑Ô∏è Support for tags, priorities, lists, and due dates
- ‚úÖ Quick task completion with Option+Enter
- üéØ Works with modern ClickUp IDs (14+ characters)

**Download:** [ClickUp.alfredworkflow](link-here)
**GitHub:** https://github.com/four13co/alfred-clickup-four13

Configuration is simple - just run `cu:config` and follow the prompts. All sensitive data is stored securely in your Keychain.

Would love feedback from the community! This is actively maintained, so please report any issues on GitHub.

### Title: Just released an updated Alfred workflow for ClickUp - looking for testers!

Hey everyone,

If you're a ClickUp + Alfred user on macOS, I've just released a new workflow that fixes many issues with the older workflows that stopped working.

**What makes this different:**
- Actually works with ClickUp 2.0 API 
- Secure credential storage (Keychain, not plain text)
- Supports modern ClickUp IDs
- Fuzzy search that actually finds your tasks
- One-key shortcuts to complete tasks

I built this because the existing workflows were either broken or storing API keys insecurely. 

**Commands:**
- `cu task title` - Create a task
- `cus keyword` - Search all tasks
- `cu:config` - Easy setup wizard

GitHub: https://github.com/four13co/alfred-clickup-four13

Would love some beta testers to try it out and provide feedback!

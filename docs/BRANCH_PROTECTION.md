# Branch Protection Configuration

## Recommended Settings for Beta Branch

After merging PR #5, the CI/CD pipeline is now ready for branch protection. Configure the following settings in GitHub:

### Navigate to Settings
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add a branch protection rule for `beta`

### Required Status Checks
Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging" and select:
- `unit-tests (3.9)`
- `unit-tests (3.10)`
- `unit-tests (3.11)`
- `security-scan`
- `code-quality`
- `build-workflow`
- `test-built-workflow`
- `ci-success`
- `build` (from PR Build Check workflow)

### Additional Recommended Settings
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging (1 review minimum)
- ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- ✅ Require review from CODEOWNERS (if configured)
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Include administrators (optional, but recommended for consistency)

### Merge Settings
- ✅ Allow squash merging (recommended for cleaner history)
- ✅ Allow merge commits
- ❌ Allow rebase merging (optional, can cause issues with protected branches)

## For Production (master) Branch

Apply the same settings with these additions:
- Require 2 pull request reviews
- Restrict who can push to matching branches (only maintainers)
- Require signed commits (if team uses GPG signing)

## Verification

After configuration, test by:
1. Creating a test PR to beta
2. Verifying all status checks are required
3. Attempting to merge without passing checks (should be blocked)
4. Ensuring all checks pass before merge is allowed

## Current Status

As of 2025-08-03:
- ✅ All CI/CD workflows configured and passing
- ✅ 9 comprehensive status checks available
- ⏳ Branch protection needs manual configuration in GitHub Settings
- ✅ Successfully tested with PR #5 merge
